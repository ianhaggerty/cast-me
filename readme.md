# cast-me

`cast-me` is a CLI app designed to automate the transcoding of video files (presumably screencasts). I originally created it due reduce the enormous file size of my quicktime screencasts.

Feature set it pretty thin at the moment. It does what I need it to do (for now). See RoadMap for ambitions - when time / motivation permits.

### **Check out the feature set below!**

![Basic Features](docs/gifs/introduction.gif)

I've dialled in a **single preset for coding screencasts**. FPS at 8 with no loss in the number of pixels. On longer `.mov` files, it's usual to see ~5% of the original file size.

## ðŸŒŽ Road Map

- Remove dependency on CLI `prompt` libraries
  - Re-implement using [`Ink`](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) react-renderer.
- Use [Redux-Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) and [MemoryRouter](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/MemoryRouter) to manage state of application.
- Flesh out configuration options
  - FPS
  - Bitrate
  - Concatenate (with timecode meta output)
  - Transition
  - Overlay
  - ...
- Presets
- Local configuration files
- Web interface
- [Youtube Upload](https://quanticdev.com/articles/automating-my-youtube-uploads-using-nodejs/)
- Versioning / [NPM publishing](https://zellwk.com/blog/publish-to-npm/)
- [commander](https://github.com/tj/commander.js#readme) for CLI flag UI design.
- Use [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - In hindsight, I much - much prefer developing with Typescript.

## `ffmpeg`

These links formed some of my initial education into `ffmpeg`. `cast-me` now delegates to [`fluent-ffmpeg`](https://github.com/fluent-ffmpeg/node-fluent-ffmpeg) - a very convenient wrapper for node.
